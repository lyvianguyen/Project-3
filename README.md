# Team Members: Lyvia Nguyen, Alan Grubb, Kikelomo Ijagbemi, Dev Paul, Taylor Wilson, Abiodun Oseni
# This project uses Python flask-powered API and Postgres SQL database to clean and sort the causes of death across the United States.
# Data source: https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD
#	**Using Plotly, a webpage with maps showing the number of death across states in the US is shown.**
# The dropdown menu is used to display the map for different calendar year.
# The json file uses flask to import the data from the database.
# JS library to be updated.................
# For this project, visualization techniques include Geo Maps, Bar Chart, and Scatter plots.
# Questions to answer:
• What are the top causes of death per state? Deadliest state?
• Does the cause of death vary per year (1999-2017)?
• Death rate per population in the states.
